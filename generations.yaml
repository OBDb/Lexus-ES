    end_year: 1991
    description: "The original Lexus ES (ES 250) was introduced alongside the flagship LS 400 as part of the brand's launch lineup. Based on the Toyota Camry platform, the first ES featured conservative styling with a formal roofline and chrome accents. Powered by a 2.5-liter V6 engine producing 156 horsepower paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, it offered modest performance focused on smooth, comfortable operation rather than sportiness. The interior provided a luxurious environment with standard leather seating, wood trim, power accessories, and premium audio. While often overshadowed by the revolutionary LS 400, the ES 250 established the model's identity as Lexus's entry-level luxury sedan with an emphasis on comfort and refinement. Sales were relatively modest during this short first generation, but it laid the foundation for what would become one of Lexus's most successful models."

Powered by a 3.0-liter V6 producing 185 horsepower (later increased to 188 hp), it offered improved performance while maintaining its focus on smooth, quiet operation. The interior was significantly upgraded with more premium materials, improved ergonomics, and additional luxury features. This generation established the ES as a strong seller in the entry-luxury segment, appealing to buyers seeking comfort and quality over sporting pretensions. A minor refresh in 1994 brought styling updates and additional features. The second-generation ES helped solidify Lexus's position in the luxury market by offering accessible luxury with the brand's growing reputation for quality and reliability."

The design featured a sleek profile with a pronounced trunk lid, chrome accents, and jewel-like headlamps. Initially powered by a 3.0-liter V6 with 210 horsepower, it was upgraded to a 3.3-liter V6 producing 225 horsepower for 2004, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. The interior space increased significantly, with special attention paid to rear seat legroom. Luxury appointments included premium leather, genuine wood trim, available heated and ventilated seats, navigation system, and Mark Levinson audio. This generation introduced more advanced technology, including adaptive cruise control, rain-sensing wipers, and power rear sunshade. Ride quality was further refined with improved sound insulation and suspension tuning. The fourth generation ES strengthened its position as Lexus's comfort-oriented luxury sedan, distinguishing itself more clearly from the sportier IS model and providing a compelling alternative to European competitors focused on performance."

    description: "The fifth generation ES 350 featured more distinctive styling with a sleek, modern design that better differentiated it from the Toyota Camry platform it shared. Powered by a new 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 272 horsepower paired with a six-speed automatic transmission, it offered improved performance with 0-60 mph times under 7 seconds. The interior was completely redesigned with a focus on luxury and technology, featuring semi-aniline leather, real wood trim, and improved ergonomics. New technology included keyless entry and ignition, available navigation with backup camera, Bluetooth connectivity, and USB audio input. This generation also introduced a panoramic glass roof option and improved safety features including adaptive front lighting and upgraded airbag systems. The fifth generation ES reinforced its position as a comfort-focused luxury sedan, growing sales significantly in North America and emerging markets, particularly China.

    description: "The sixth generation ES marked a significant evolution, switching to the larger Toyota Avalon platform and introducing the ES 300h hybrid model alongside the V6-powered ES 350. The design featured the most aggressive implementation of Lexus's spindle grille to date on the ES, with sharper lines and a more dynamic profile. The ES 350 continued with a 3.5-liter V6, now producing 268 horsepower, while the ES 300h combined a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with electric motors for a total system output of 200 horsepower and impressive fuel economy ratings of 40 mpg combined. The interior was significantly upgraded with higher quality materials, improved technology, and increased rear seat space (especially important for the Chinese market). Notable features included available bamboo trim, heated and ventilated seats, ambient lighting, and the second-generation Lexus Remote Touch interface. Safety technology expanded to include pre-collision system, lane departure alert, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert. A 2016 mid-cycle refresh brought an even more pronounced spindle grille, LED headlights, and additional safety features through the Lexus Safety System+ package. This generation solidified the ES's global importance to the Lexus brand, particularly in China where it became a top seller in the luxury segment."

The ES 350 continues with a 3.5-liter V6 producing 302 horsepower, while the ES 300h hybrid combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with electric motors for 215 total system horsepower and up to 44 mpg combined. A new ES 250 model with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive joined the lineup for 2021. The interior represents a major upgrade with higher quality materials including available semi-aniline leather, Japanese-inspired design elements, and improved technology featuring a 12.3-inch infotainment display with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa integration. The Mark Levinson PurePlay sound system with 17 speakers delivers exceptional audio quality.
